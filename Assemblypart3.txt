assign a variable to 3
assign a variable to 5 
assign a variable to 0
mov 3 to eax
multiply 3 by 5 and put into eax
move 15 into edx
move 3 into eax
move eax into ecx
divide ecx by 2^eax(1F)
add that value back to eax = 3
divide eax by 2 = 
edx - eax into edx = 
move that value into eax
move into a the 3rd variable declaration the value in eax
sets up the print for the variable and prints it
